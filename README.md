# Description of Project: 
This project rigorously analyzed relational and non-relational database paradigms within the context of Advanced Databases.

Through meticulous schema design, indexing, and query optimizations, this project provided a comprehensive exploration of database structures and performance enhancements across SQLite and MongoDB, highlighting the nuanced differences between relational and non-relational approaches.

Using the same data, we created two DataBases:

## SQL DataBase Schema:

The times shown refer to the simple and complex select queries and the times are shown in seconds.
